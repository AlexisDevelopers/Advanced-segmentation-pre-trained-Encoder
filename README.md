This project is an implementation of an advanced image segmentation technique using a pre-trained encoder. The project is designed to segment pet images from the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset using an autoencoder architecture with a pretrained ResNet50 encoder.

First, the project loads the dataset using TensorFlow Datasets and processes the images and segmentation masks using a load_image function. Images are resized to 128x128 pixels and masks are also resized and normalized. The preprocessing step also includes the ResNet50 preprocessing function.

After loading and preprocessing the dataset, the project implements an autoencoder architecture with a pretrained ResNet50 encoder. The encoder is loaded with pretrained weights and frozen for the first 12 layers to retain its pretrained feature extraction capabilities. The encoder is then flattened and connected to a dense layer with dimension 10, which serves as the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder.

The decoder is created using transposed convolutional layers and is connected to the bottleneck layer of the encoder. The decoder includes three transposed convolutional layers, each with a decreasing number of filters and increasing kernel size. The final layer uses softmax activation to generate a segmentation mask.

Separate models for the encoder and decoder are created and combined to create the autoencoder. The autoencoder is then compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The model is trained on the training data set and validated on the test data set. The model is monitored for validation accuracy using early stopping with a patience of 5 epochs.

Overall, this project demonstrates how to use an encoder pretrained with an autoencoder architecture for advanced image segmentation tasks. The implementation can be useful for various applications, including medical image segmentation, object detection, and more.
